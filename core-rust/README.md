# core-rust

This folder contains the Rust implementation of the SÎ› framework, mirroring the formal definitions and proofs in `core-lean/` with high-performance computational structures.

## Purpose

- Provide type-safe data structures for semantic universes.
- Implement gluing evaluators, descent algorithms, and entropy estimators.
- Enable real-time evaluation and testing of semantic agents.

## Connection to `core-lean/`

The `core-rust/` module serves as the computational counterpart to the formal logic and semantics defined in `core-lean/`. It ensures that the theoretical constructs are executable and testable in real-world scenarios.
